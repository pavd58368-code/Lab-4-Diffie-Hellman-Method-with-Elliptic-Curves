Lab 4 ‚Äì Diffie-Hellman Method with Elliptic Curves
Objective and Task Statement

The goal of this work is to develop a program implementation of the Diffie-Hellman method using elliptic curves.
The implementation should:

Check whether a given point lies on the elliptic curve (formula 8.2).

Perform scalar multiplication of a point by a secret key.

Ensure that both participants in the key exchange obtain the same result.


Input Data

Programming language: Python
Parameters of elliptic curve:  a,b,p
Base point: G=(x,y)
Secret keys: ùëò1,ùëò2

Algorithm Description

Define elliptic curve with parameters a,b,p.

Check whether the given point  G(x,y) belongs to the curve.

Implement point addition:

  For two different points.

  For the same point (doubling).

Implement scalar multiplication of a point  k‚ãÖG using the binary expansion method (double-and-add).

Each participant multiplies the base point by their secret key and exchanges the result.

Both compute the final shared key by multiplying the received point with their own secret key.	‚Äã

Results and Analysis

Program checks if base point 

G belongs to the curve.

Computes values of scalar multiplications:


R1=k1‚ãÖG


R2=k2‚ãÖG

Both participants, after exchange, obtain the same shared key.
